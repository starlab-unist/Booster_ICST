# Dataset

To evaluate the effectiveness of Booster, we compare the bug detection and coverage of Randoop, EvoSuite, and Booster on 833 bugs from Defects4J. 
Additionally, to mitigate bias due to random seeds, we repeat the experiments using different random seeds for each bug.

## [Bug Detection](./bug_detection/)

We execute the generated tests on both the buggy and fixed versions of each bug. 
If a test case exhibit different behavior between the two versions, we consider that the test suite trigger the bug. 
Furthermore, if the bug is triggered even once in five repeated experiments, we consider that bug to be detected.

### Common

CSV files commonly contain the following keywords, each representing the following concepts:

* generation_time_budget
    * Time budget allocated to the tool for generating tests.
* project
    * Defects4J project to which the bug belongs.
    * ex) Chart
* bug_id
    * An id of the bug within the project.
    * ex) Chart 1
* test_id
    * Iteration number of the five repeated experiments.
    * 0,1,2,3,4
* bug_detection
    * Whether the generated test detect the bug.
    * yes: detected
    * no: not detected

### Bug detection results of [Booster](./bug_detection/Booster_bug_detection.csv)

To evaluate how much Booster enhances the bug detection of the initial test suite, we generate new test suites using Booster and evaluate the bug detection of these generated tests. 
The bug detection CSV file for Booster tests includes the following additional keywords:

* initial_test_suite_tool
    * Test generation tool used for generating initial test suite of Booster
* initial_test_suite_generation_time
    * Time budget usde for generating initial test suite of Booster
* mode
    * Assembling method of Booster used in generating new test suite

### Bug detection results of [Randoop](./bug_detection/RD_bug_detection.csv), [EvoSuite](./bug_detection/ES_bug_detection.csv) and [EvoSuite<sup>-</sup>](./bug_detection/ESM_bug_detection.csv) (without minimization)

We use Randoop and EvoSuite to generate the initial test suite for Booster. 
Additionally, to evaluate Booster's efficiency we compare it with tests generated by EvoSuite with its default minimization process removed. 
We denote this version of EvoSuite as EvoSuite<sup>-</sup>.

## [Coverage](./coverage/)

In Research Question 1, we measure the coverage of the new test suite generated by Booster to determine whether the improvement in bug detection was due to increased coverage.
Additionally, in Section 3, we measure the coverage at various time budgets to observe the coverage increase trend of existing test generation tools.

### Common

CSV files commonly contain the following keywords, each representing the following concepts:

* generation_time_budget
    * Time budget allocated to the tool for generating tests.
* project
    * Defects4J project to which the bug belongs.
    * ex) Chart
* bug_id
    * An id of the bug within the project.
    * ex) Chart 1
* test_id
    * Iteration number of the five repeated experiments.
    * 0,1,2,3,4
* coverage
    * branch coverage ($\frac{A\ number\ of\ covered\ branch}{A\ number\ of\ total\ branch}* 100)$

### Coverage results of [Booster](./coverage/Booster_coverage.csv)

Each data in CSV file represents the branch coverage of the class containing the bug, covered by the test suite generated by Booster.
The bug detection CSV file for Booster tests includes the following additional keywords:
